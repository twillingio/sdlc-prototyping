# SDLC Prototyping

This is a repo without particularly interesting code. It primarily serves as a sandbox for prototyping a SDLC enforcement policy driven by a GitHub app

## Branch protection rules

- No reviewers are required
- PRs can only be merged by a bot user
- CircleCI must pass on any PRs going into master
